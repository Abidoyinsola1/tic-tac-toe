- The board has 9 empty cells
- There are two symbols — "X" and "O" that represents the first and the second players
- Players take turns playing by entering their numbers represented by the symbols into empty cells.
- Negative numbers, symbols, letters... are not allowed.
- The first player to get three of his/her tokens in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- The game ends in a tie if all nine cells are occupied and there is no winner.

### How do we play Tic Tac Toe

- Players take turns playing.
- 1st turn — Player 1
- Player 1 will be asked to choose their position. The position could be any number from 1 - 9.
- 2nd turn — Player 2.
- Player 2 will be asked to choose their position. The position could be any number from 1 - 9, except they can’t touch the number that Player 1’s symbol already fills.
- 3rd turn- Player 1…. The cycle continue until a player wins or there’s a tie game.
- There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal.
- There’s a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X’s and O’s but no winning combinations can be found.
